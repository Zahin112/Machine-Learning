Assignment 2: Logistic Regression with Bagging
Apply logistic regression to this Bank Note Authentication dataset. 
A CSV file is also included in the code base. Your goal is to predict whether a banknote 
is original.

Class 0 (Negative class): Fake
Class 1 (Positive class): Original

Please find the necessary boilerplate codes here > Assignment 2 Code Base 
There are missing parts in the code that you need to implement. You have two tasks.

Task 1: Simple Logistic Regression
Refer to run_logistic_regression.py. That code should handle data reading, splitting, 
training, and performance reporting.

Task 2: Logistic Regression with Bagging
Refer to run_logistic_regression_with_bagging.py. That code should handle data reading, 
splitting, training, and performance reporting. For ensembling, you need to train classifiers 
on different samples from the training dataset. The BaggingClassifier class should be able to 
generate samples and train separate classifiers on its own.

Additional Information
You must use NumPy and Pandas.
Using Sklearn, Scikit, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch - or other frameworks that include these 
implementations is prohibited.
Please refer to Precision and recall - Wikipedia for the performance metrics 
Write the code in such a way that you can quickly incorporate a new dataset 
(with a different number of samples and attributes)
You donâ€™t have to follow the design pattern by heart. You are allowed some creative 
independence.
